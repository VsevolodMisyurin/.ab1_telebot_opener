This Telegram bot is designed to assist researchers in processing their .ab1 file format. You can upload the file to the chat and receive information about the read DNA sequence as a string and in FASTA format, and obtain an electropherogram. You can also get a 12se pair fragment of the electropherogram on both sides of the user-selected base.
